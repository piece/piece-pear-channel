What's New in Piece_Flow 1.16.0

 * Enhanced interfaces: getActiveFlowExecutionTicket() has been added to the Piece_Flow_Continuation_Service class. It can be used to get the flow execution ticket for the active flow execution. And also isViewState() has been added to the Piece_Flow class. It can be used to get whether the current state of a flow execution is a view state or not.
 * Improved error handling: The behavior of internal error handling has been changed so as to handle only own and &quot;exception&quot; level errors.
 * A defect fix: A defect that the outer frame of an already removed flow execution to be created by garbage collection has been fixed.

See the following release notes for details.

Defect Fixes

            This release includes a feature named &quot;Action Continuation&quot; and several enhancements.

&quot;Action Continuation&quot; is a very important feature for developers. This feature will allow developers to write stateful action code via the properties without using flow attributes. This means that the programming be nearer natural continuation programming, although it is limited the scope in the action.

See the following release notes for details.

## Enhancements ##

### Piece_Flow_Continuation, Piece_Flow_Action_Factory ###

- Added a feature to store the action instances as a flow attribute in a flow execution, and restore the action instances when continuing the flow execution. (Ticket #13)

### Piece_Flow_Continuation ###

- Removed setActionDirectory().
- Changed to start a new flow execution if another flow execution of the current flow already exists in the flow executions. (Ticket #14)
- Added isExclusive() to check whether the curent flow execution is exclusive or not.
- Added getCurrentFlowName() to get the current flow name.

### Piece_Flow_Action_Factory ###

- Added clearInstances() to clear all instances of actions. (Ticket #12)
- Moved _load() to load() as a public method.

What's New in Piece_Unity 1.4.0

 * Full flow name as view prefix: A feature so that the full flow name can be used as the view prefix by turning on &quot;useFullFlowNameAsViewPrefix&quot;. (default: on) If you want to keep backward compatibility with Piece_Unity 1.3.0/1.3.1 configurations, set false to &quot;useFullFlowNameAsViewPrefix&quot;. For example, if there is a view &quot;Baz&quot;, the final view of &quot;Baz&quot; by different flow names and states of &quot;useFullFlowNameAsViewPrefix&quot; as follows:

+-----------+-----------+-------------+
| flow name | off/1.3.x | on          |
+-----------+-----------+-------------+
| Foo       | Baz       | Foo_Baz     |
+-----------+-----------+-------------+
| Foo_Bar   | Foo_Baz   | Foo_Bar_Baz |

            Hi all,

A new release of Piece_Unity is now available.
For Piece_Unity, this will be a big release because this release includes a very important feature named &quot;Action Continuation&quot; and several powerful enhancements as follows.

&quot;Action Continuation&quot; is a very important feature for developers. This feature allows developers to write stateful action code via the properties without using flow attributes. In fact it allows stateful programming without thinking sessions. This means that the programming be nearer natural continuation programming, although it is limited the scope in the action.

Interceptor_Authentication plug-in provides a smart and simple solution for authentication.

Renderer_Flexy, Renderer_Smarty, and Renderer_PHP plug-ins provide a simple and useful layout system to reuse shared html layout across multiple pages.

Renderer_JSON plug-in allows to output view elements as JSON.

Also the example applications was restructured with new features as follows. (Sorry there are no JSON examples yet.)

A. Registration Applications

   1. A registration application. *non-exclusive*
   2. A registration application. *exclusive*
   3. A registration application with AHAH. *exclusive*

B. Authentication

   1. An authentication service. *exclusive*
   2. A resource which is protected by the above authentication service. *non-exclusive*

These examples will be available on the web one of these days.

And also other enhancements are included.

See the following release notes for details.

 Sometimes PHPUnit reports warning messages such as follows:

 Warning: Deprecated PHPUnit features are being used 1 times!
 Use --verbose for more information.

 If the &quot;--verbose&quot; option is enabled, PHPUnit reports more detailed information as follows:

 PHPUnit 3.5.10 by Sebastian Bergmann.

 ...................

 Time: 0 seconds, Memory: 3.50Mb

 /home/iteman/GITREPOS/stagehand-fsm/test/Stagehand/FSM/FSMTest.php:(between 281 and 297) - assertType() will be removed in PHPUnit 3.6 and should no longer be used. assertInternalType() should be used for asserting internal types such as &quot;integer&quot; or &quot;string&quot; whereas assertInstanceOf() should be used for asserting that an object is an instance of a specified class or interface.
 ...

 This information would be useful to improve your test code.

What's New in Stagehand_TestRunner 2.8.0

 Runs only the tests in the specified classes. (PHPUnit only):

  phpunitrunner --classes=CLASS1,CLASS2,... FILE

  Runs the tests in the specified classes which are included in the specified file. Multiple classes can be specified by a comma delimited list.

 Improvements for testing specified methods:

  Can specify fully-qualified method names.:

   In the version 2.7.0, if multiple classes have same method, their methods are run when testing specified methods.

   As of this version, fully-qualified method names can be specified as CLASS::METHOD for resolving this ambiguity.

  Be case-insensitive.:

   In the version 2.7.0, it is case-sensitive even though PHP methods are case-insensitive.

   As of this version, it has been made case-insensitive.
