 /home/iteman/GITREPOS/stagehand-fsm/test/Stagehand/FSM/FSMTest.php:(between 281 and 297) - assertType() will be removed in PHPUnit 3.6 and should no longer be used. assertInternalType() should be used for asserting internal types such as &quot;integer&quot; or &quot;string&quot; whereas assertInstanceOf() should be used for asserting that an object is an instance of a specified class or interface.
