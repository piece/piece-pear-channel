What's New in Stagehand_TestRunner 3.3.0

Improved Autoloading for Stagehand_TestRunner's Classes

 (Issue #6)

 The launcher script &quot;testrunner&quot; has been changed as follows:

 * Does not load Composer's autoload.php.
 * Loads Stagehand/TestRunner/Core/Bootstrap.php only if the Stagehand\TestRunner\Core\Bootstrap class does not exist.

Sets the memory_limit directive to -1.

 (Issue #5)

 Sometimes MakeGood, an unexpected error &quot;Fatal error: Allowed memory size of xxx bytes exhausted ...&quot; is raised when running a test even though the memory_limit directive is set to -1 in the php.ini file. The memory_limit directive is now set to -1 to avoid raising this error.

A Defect Fix

 The following defect has been fixed:

 * [PHPUnit] Specifying test methods do not work with the groups. (Issue #4)
