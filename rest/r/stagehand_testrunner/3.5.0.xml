What's New in Stagehand_TestRunner 3.5.0

Uses the PEAR's php_bin as the PHP executable when the testrunner command is run as a program.

 (Issue #16)

 When the testrunner command is run as a program, the value of PHP CLI/CGI binary (php_bin) of your PEAR installation is now used as the PHP executable.
