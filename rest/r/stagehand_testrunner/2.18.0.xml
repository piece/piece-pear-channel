What's New in Stagehand_TestRunner 2.18.0

Improved Notifications

 (Issue #309, #311)

 The following improvements have been made:

 * Provides the icons for notifications.
 * Uses the &quot;growlnotify&quot; command (Windows, Mac OS X) or the &quot;notify-send&quot; command instead of the Net_Growl package.
 * Sends the fatal error message when monitoring changes.

 For more information, see the User Guide (http://redmine.piece-framework.com/projects/stagehand-testrunner/wiki/Stagehand_TestRunner_User_Guide_2_18_0#Notifies-test-results).

Runs tests at the beginning of monitoring changes.

 (Issue #318)

 If the &quot;-a&quot; option is specified, Stagehand_TestRunner runs tests unconditionally at the beginning.

 The following defects have been fixed:

 * The preload script is not loaded when specifying multiple options after one &quot;-&quot;. (Issue #312)
 * Some command line options are lost with the monitoring feature. (Issue #314)
 * An underscore is not treated as a word separator in TestDox. (Issue #317)
