What's New in Stagehand_TestRunner 2.8.0

 Runs only the tests in the specified classes. (PHPUnit only):

  phpunitrunner --classes=CLASS1,CLASS2,... FILE

  Runs the tests in the specified classes which are included in the specified file. Multiple classes can be specified by a comma delimited list.

 Improvements for testing specified methods:

  Can specify fully-qualified method names.:

   In the version 2.7.0, if multiple classes have same method, their methods are run when testing specified methods.

   As of this version, fully-qualified method names can be specified as CLASS::METHOD for resolving this ambiguity.

  Be case-insensitive.:

   In the version 2.7.0, it is case-sensitive even though PHP methods are case-insensitive.

   As of this version, it has been made case-insensitive.
