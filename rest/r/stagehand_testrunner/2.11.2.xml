What's New in Stagehand_TestRunner 2.11.2

 Two defect fixes

  (Issue #173, #175)

  A defect has been fixed that caused a start tag not to be closed when the tag and all attributes are written. And also a defect has been fixed that caused TestDox output to be broken if the same test method names except trailing numbers.
