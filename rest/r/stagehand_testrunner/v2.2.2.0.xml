    <n>A new release of Stagehand_TestRunner is now available.

What's New in Stagehand_TestRunner 2.2.0

 * Test.php support: Test classes ending with &quot;Test.php&quot; have become targets of running tests by testrunner/testrunner-st (PHPUnit/SimpleTest).
 * Test class extensions: Extending test classes has become a lot easier since the PHPUnit/SimpleTest collectors now target only classes ending with Test or TestCase.

See the following release notes for details.
