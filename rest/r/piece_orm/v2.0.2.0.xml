Enhancements
============ 

Mappers:

- Added a feature so as to throw an exception if detecting problem when building a query. (Ticket #9)
- Changed the method naming convention to not require &quot;By&quot; for findXXX/findAllXXX methods like &quot;findByXXX&quot;, &quot;findAllByXXX&quot;.
- Added support for relationships.
- Added support for LIMIT and OFFSET with setLimit(). (Ticket #14)
- Added support ORDER BY clause with addOrder(). (Ticket #21)
- Added support for Identity Map. (Ticket #23)
- Added createObject() to create an object from metadata.
- Moved _executeQuery() to public.
- Added findWithQuery() to find an object with a query.
- Added method name validation.
- Changed delete() so that its argument can only be specified an object.
- Added createObject() to create an object from metadata.
- Changed behavior for creating/getting mapper objects so that the factory sets the current database handle to a mapper object every time it is called.
- Removed the method element.

Entry Point:

- Removed a Piece_ORM_Config object from the arguments of configure().
- Added getConfiguration() to get the Piece_ORM_Config object after calling configure().
- Updated getMapper()/getConfiguration() so as to return null if calling their methods before calling configure().
- Removed two the cache directories for mappers/metadata from the arguments of configure(). Now, the caches of mappers/metadata are stored in the same directory where a Piece_ORM_Config object is cached in.
- Updated configure() so as to set the current database explicitly.
- Added setDatabase() for setting a database as the current database.
- Added createObject() to create an object from metadata.
- Added dressObject() to convert an object into a specified object.

Metadata:

- Added hasField() for checking whether a table has the given field.

Kernel:

- Removed the default value from getDSN()/getOptions(). (Piece_ORM_Config)
- Changed the way of configuration. Now setDSN(), setOptions(), and setDirectorySuffix() methods are used for configuration instead of addConfiguration(). (Piece_ORM_Config)
- Removed addConfiguration(). (Piece_ORM_Config)
- Added getDefaultDatabase() for getting the default database. (Piece_ORM_Config)
- Adjusted to the new way of configuration. (Piece_ORM_Config_Factory)
- Added setMapperConfigDirectory() for setting the configuration directory for the mapper configuration. (Piece_ORM_Context)
- Updated setDatabase() so as to set the configuration directory with a directory suffix for the mapper configuration. (Piece_ORM_Context)
- Added an error code PIECE_ORM_ERROR_INVALID_CONFIGURATION. (Piece_ORM_Error)
- Added support for PostgreSQL &quot;timestamp with time zone&quot;.

Defect Fixes
============ 

Mappers:

- Fixed a problem that a built-in query is overwritten if only the relationship element is given for a built-in method.
- Fixed a problem that a literal as a criterion cannot use with user-defined method.</n>
