    <s>A Web application framework</s>
    <d>Piece_Unity is a Web application framework.

Piece_Unity allows stateful programming without thinking about sessions by storing and restoring states with a technology known as continuation server. It also provides high security and eases the burden of implementing security measures for applications by application flow control.</d>

    <n>A new release of Piece_Unity is now available.

What's New in Piece_Unity 1.7.0

 * Two defect fixes: A defect has been fixed that caused a URI scheme for redirection to be &quot;http&quot; on SSL by non-standard port. And another defect has been fixed.
 * Some improvements: A method setConfigurationCallback() has been added to set the callback for createRuntime(), and the behavior of createRuntime() has been changed so as to call the callback by setConfigurationCallback() if the callback by the argument is not given. And there are a few more improvements.

Backward Compatibility

 * Redirection to internal URIs: When redirecting to a internal URI, the scheme of the given URI (http/https) is always kept.
 * Piece_Unity_Component_Authentication: Piece_Unity_Component_Authentication 1.1.1 or less does not work properly with Piece_Unity 1.7.0. Upgrade to the upcoming version 1.1.2.

See the following release notes for details.

- Changed the behavior of createRuntime() so as to call the callback by setConfigurationCallback() if the callback by the argument is not given. (Piece_Unity)
