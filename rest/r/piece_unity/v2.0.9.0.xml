    <s>A Web application framework</s>
    <d>Piece_Unity is a Web application framework.

Piece_Unity allows stateful programming without thinking about sessions by storing and restoring states with a technology known as continuation server. It also provides high security and eases the burden of implementing security measures for applications by application flow control.</d>

    <n>Hi all,

A new release of Piece_Unity is now available.
For Piece_Unity, this will be a big release because this release includes a very important feature named &quot;Action Continuation&quot; and several powerful enhancements as follows.

&quot;Action Continuation&quot; is a very important feature for developers. This feature allows developers to write stateful action code via the properties without using flow attributes. In fact it allows stateful programming without thinking sessions. This means that the programming be nearer natural continuation programming, although it is limited the scope in the action.

Interceptor_Authentication plug-in provides a smart and simple solution for authentication.

Renderer_Flexy, Renderer_Smarty, and Renderer_PHP plug-ins provide a simple and useful layout system to reuse shared html layout across multiple pages.

Renderer_JSON plug-in allows to output view elements as JSON.

Also the example applications was restructured with new features as follows. (Sorry there are no JSON examples yet.)

A. Registration Applications

   1. A registration application. *non-exclusive*
   2. A registration application. *exclusive*
   3. A registration application with AHAH. *exclusive*

B. Authentication

   1. An authentication service. *exclusive*
   2. A resource which is protected by the above authentication service. *non-exclusive*

These examples will be available on the web one of these days.

And also other enhancements are included.

See the following release notes for details.
