Piece_Flow provides a stateful programming model for developers, and high security for applications.</d>
    <da>2007-09-28 12:34:37</da>
    <n>A new release of Piece_Flow is now available.

What's New in Piece_Flow 1.14.0

 * Two new interfaces for the continuation server: Two new interfaces for the continuation server have been available. One is Piece_Flow_Continuation_Service. The other is Piece_Flow_Continuation_Server. Piece_Flow_Continuation_Service is a service class which provides simple interfaces to access attributes of the active flow object and to get some information from flow executions. Users should use this class instead of Piece_Flow_Continuation from this release forward. Piece_Flow_Continuation_Server is a class which just provides the features for the continuation server only. Framework developers should use this class instead of Piece_Flow_Continuation from this release forward. Besides, Piece_Flow_Continuation has been deprecated.
 * A Defect Fix: A defect that caused the same cache to be used if the relative paths of the flow definition files are same even though the absolute paths of the files are different has been fixed.

See the following release notes for details.
