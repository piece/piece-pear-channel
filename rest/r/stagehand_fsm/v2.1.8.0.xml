    <s>A finite state machine</s>
    <d>Stagehand_FSM is a finite state machine.

Manual state management makes code complex, decreases intentionality. By using Stagehand_FSM, state management code can be declaratively represented in the form of FSM. This makes code simpler, increases intentionality.

Stagehand_FSM can be used as an infrastructure for domain-specific languages (DSLs). Examples are workflow engines, page flow engines such as Piece_Flow.</d>
